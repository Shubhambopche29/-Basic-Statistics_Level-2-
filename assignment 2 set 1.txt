                     Morgan Stanley (91.36%) would be an outlier.


To calculate the mean, sum all of the percentages and divide by the number of values in the data set. In this case, the mean would be:

μ = (24.23 + 25.53 + 25.41 + 24.14 + 29.62 + 28.25 + 25.81 + 24.39 + 40.26 + 32.95 + 91.36 + 25.99 + 39.42 + 26.71 + 35.00) / 15 = 31.89%

To calculate the standard deviation, you can use the following formula:

σ = sqrt(((x1 - μ)^2 + (x2 - μ)^2 + ... + (xn - μ)^2) / (n - 1))

where x1, x2, ..., xn are the values in the data set, μ is the mean, and n is the number of values in the data set.

In this case, the standard deviation would be:

σ = sqrt(((24.23 - 31.89)^2 + (25.53 - 31.89)^2 + ... + (35.00 - 31.89)^2) / 14)
= sqrt((-7.66^2 + -6.36^2 + ... + 3.11^2) / 14)
= sqrt(1334.77 / 14)
= sqrt(95.34)
= 9.77%

You can also calculate the variance, which is the square of the standard deviation. In this case, the variance would be σ^2 = 9.77%^2 = 95.34%.





	Q4) First, we can find the probability that a call is misdirected by dividing the number of misdirected calls by the total number of calls, which is 1/200.

Next, we can find the probability that a call is not misdirected by subtracting the probability of a call being misdirected from 1, which is 1 - (1/200) = 199/200.

Since we are trying to find the probability that at least one in five attempted telephone calls reaches the wrong number, we can use the complement rule to find the probability that none of the five attempted calls reach the wrong number. This probability is equal to the probability that all five calls are not misdirected, which is (199/200)^5 = 0.831.

Finally, we can find the probability that at least one in five attempted telephone calls reaches the wrong number by subtracting the probability that none of the calls are misdirected from 1, which is 1 - 0.831 = 0.169.

Therefore, the probability that at least one in five attempted telephone calls reaches the wrong number is approximately 0.169.






Q5)

(i) The most likely monetary outcome of the business venture is $2,000, as this is the value of x with the highest probability (0.3).

(ii) It is not clear whether the venture is likely to be successful based on the given probability distribution. In order to determine whether the venture is likely to be successful, we would need to know the definition of success and whether the expected return is sufficient to meet that definition.

(iii) The long-term average earning of business ventures of this kind can be calculated by multiplying each possible outcome by its probability and summing the results. This is known as the expected value. Using the given probability distribution, the expected value is (-$2,000 * 0.1) + (-$1,000 * 0.1) + ($0 * 0.2) + ($1,000 * 0.2) + ($2,000 * 0.3) + ($3,000 * 0.1) = $1,000. Therefore, the long-term average earning of business ventures of this kind is $1,000.

(iv) A good measure of the risk involved in a venture of this kind is the standard deviation, which is a measure of how much the outcomes of the venture are expected to vary from the mean. To calculate the standard deviation, we can use the following formula:

σ = sqrt(((x1 - μ)^2 * P(x1) + (x2 - μ)^2 * P(x2) + ... + (xn - μ)^2 * P(xn)) / (n - 1))
where x1, x2, ..., xn are the possible outcomes, P(x1), P(x2), ..., P(xn) are their corresponding probabilities, μ is the mean of the distribution, and n is the number of possible outcomes.

In this case, the mean is $1,000 and the standard deviation is:

σ = sqrt(((-2,000 - 1,000)^2 * 0.1) + ((-1,000 - 1,000)^2 * 0.1) + ((0 - 1,000)^2 * 0.2) + ((1,000 - 1,000)^2 * 0.2) + ((2,000 - 1,000)^2 * 0.3) + ((3,000 - 1,000)^2 * 0.1)) / (6 - 1)
= sqrt((3,000,000 * 0.1) + (1,000,000 * 0.1) + (1,000,000 * 0.2) + (0 * 0.2) + (1,000,000 * 0.3) + (4,000,000 * 0.1)) / 5
= sqrt(300,000 + 100,000 + 200,000 + 0 + 300,000 + 400,000) / 5
= sqrt(1,300,000) / 5
= 1,932.9 / 5
= $386.58

Therefore, the standard deviation is approximately $386.58, which is a good measure of the risk involved in a venture of this kind. This value indicates that the outcomes of the venture are expected to vary by approximately $386.58 from the mean.
